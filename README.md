# Laith Y. Mufti | Automation & AI Portfolio

Welcome! I’m Laith Mufti—a business automation enthusiast and AI solutions builder with a passion for making work more efficient.

My interest in automation started early, when I realized how Excel macros could turn hours of repetitive work into a single button click during my internship days. As technology progressed, so did my curiosity. I began automating daily tasks for fun, looking for new ways to make life and work simpler.

Over time, this hobby grew into a focus on AI-powered business solutions. Most of the automations you’ll find here were originally built for friends and colleagues in my circle, like a senior real estate protfolio manager or an Amazon services agency owner. 
I would be talking shop with a friend and in the back of my mind I would be thinking "hmmm, actually this, this and this could be automated" or "a couple of AI agents could actually take that over" you get the gist.

This repo contains a selection of sanitized workflow demos and projects I’ve built using tools like n8n, LLMs, Airtable, APIs, and more. All sensitive content has been redacted for public sharing. If you want a deeper technical walkthrough or just want to talk automation, feel free to connect.
